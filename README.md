# DesktopGoose
 Desktop Goose is a free novelty anti-efficiency and anti-productivity software 🖥️ that will keep on pestering you. Developed by samperson, this frustratingly unusual game deploys what looks like a lovable virtual pet goose 🐤 that holds something more sinister within 😈.

🎮 Whether you’re playing a game or working on a task, the Desktop Goose will constantly create havoc by chasing your cursor 🖱️, displacing your windows 🪟, tracking mud across your screen 🟤, and launching apps such as Notepad 📓 unprompted. This silly title is inspired by games like Untitled Goose Game and SkateBIRD.

🪿 Let chaos reign

Desktop Goose is a not-so-lovely virtual pet. His pixelated yellow and white body 🟨⬜ waddles around your computer, leaving muddy footprints everywhere 👣. At first, it seems cute 🥰, but its behavior quickly spirals out of control 😵.

It may interrupt your game 🎮 with messages like “Excellent work” 💬

It can take over your mouse 🔒🖱️

Sometimes it even brings you memes 🤣

With configuration toggles ⚙️ and mods 🎨, you can adjust the goose’s behavior, aggression, and sounds 🔊. However, installation can be tedious 😤, and stopping the goose when you need to get work done can be even harder 🛑 — often requiring Task Manager.
